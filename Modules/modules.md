# Ansible Modules

Ansible modules are standalone scripts that provide the functionality to perform specific tasks on remote hosts. These modules are used within Ansible playbooks
or ad-hoc commands to automate various operations such as managing packages, files, services, and more.

## Overview

Modules in Ansible are categorized based on the type of tasks they perform. Some of the common module categories include:

- **System**: Modules for system-related tasks such as managing users, groups, files, and directories.
- **Commands**: Modules to execute commands on remote hosts and fetch their output.
- **Files**: Modules for managing files and directories, including copying, moving, and deleting files.
- **Packages**: Modules to manage packages on different package managers like apt, yum, dnf, and others.
- **Services**: Modules to manage services, such as starting, stopping, and restarting services.
- **Database**: Modules for managing databases, including creating, deleting, and modifying databases and users.
- **Cloud**: Modules to interact with various cloud platforms for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- **Networking**: Modules for managing network-related configurations, such as firewalls, VLANs, and network interfaces.

## Usage

Each module comes with its own set of parameters that define how the module behaves. These parameters are used to customize the module's behavior according to the 
specific requirements of the task.

Example of using a module in a playbook:

```yaml
- name: Ensure a package is installed
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
```
In this example, the `apt` module is used to ensure that the apache2 package is installed on the target hosts. The `name` parameter specifies the package name, and the state parameter 
defines the desired state of the package (present in this case).

## Finding Modules

You can explore the complete list of Ansible modules and their documentation on the official Ansible documentation website: Ansible Modules Documentation

Additionally, you can use the `ansible-doc` command-line tool to get information about specific modules:
 `ansible-doc <module_name>`

 Replace `<module_name>` with the name of the module you want to explore.

Using Ansible modules, you can automate a wide range of tasks across your infrastructure, making it easier to manage and maintain your systems efficiently.
